# My Coding Train Challenges

So I have been for the longest time wanting to do all the coding train challenges that was done. <br>
Beginning from the Starfield to the newest one. <br>
I feel that they are a good practice problem to do 1 everyday <br>

> And so this is the documentation of me doing each and every coding train challenge

My Method is:
- first research and understand all I can on the project and think of how to do it
- Try to do it
- If I cant follow along the video and understand how he did it
- But if I could then follow along and see the ways how he did differently

For each project I will either use p5.js, pygame or pyglet  <br>
So I will spin a wheel then use that language/framework for the challenge <br>
My Hope is that I finish all these challenges by the end of the year 2022
